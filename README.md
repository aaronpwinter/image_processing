# image_processing
Translate an image to any quadrilateral.

Requires numpy, pygame, and pillow.

Running pygame_rectangle.py will yield an example transformation, which you can hover your mouse over either image to see where that cordinate translates onto the other image. 
A main script in images.py details one way in which you can transform an image to a quadrilateral, and then save that image (an example of this is pusheen.png to edited.png).
